This repository contains a collection of basic machine learning projects I built while learning the fundamentals of ML.
Each project helped me understand different algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and evaluation methods.

**Projects Included**

📊 Linear Regression Practice – Simple regression model to understand prediction basics

🔍 Logistic Regression – Binary classification example

🌳 Decision Tree Classifier – Learning how trees split and predict

🤖 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – Classification using distance-based learning

📈 Support Vector Machine (SVM) – Experiment with separating hyperplanes

**Tech Stack**

Language: Python 

Libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook

**Goals**

Practice ML basics with small projects

Strengthen understanding of algorithms

Build a foundation for bigger ML projects
